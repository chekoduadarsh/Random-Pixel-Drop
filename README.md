# Random Pixel Drop
This is a library written for `ImageDataGenerator()` from `keras.preprocessing` library.

Random pixel drop is inspired from dropout regularisation technique and cutout image augmentation technique. This library will randomly set image pixel values of the image to zeros for a given range of number. Which will be similar to dropout than switching neurons randomly to reduce over fitting this will introduce randomness in the input image to reduce over fitting
